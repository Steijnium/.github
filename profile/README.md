## About Me

Steijnium is a freelance organization collaborating with other software teams to implement robust solutions.

My journey began with low-level machine programming and circuit design. Over the years, I transitioned into office automation and later ventured into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems. I also collaborate closely with designers for front-end aspects.

My approach is structured: I ensure functionality first, present it for client approval, and then optimize and secure the solution. This method balances efficiency with future-proofing and security.

I aim to develop systems that other developers can easily take over, providing a stable foundation for continued development. While my approach may not always be the most economical, I prioritize thoroughness in future-proofing and security.

Beyond programming, I enjoy researching technological innovations in engineering, broadening my expertise beyond software.
