## About Me

Steijnium is a freelance organization collaborating with other software teams to implement robust solutions.

My journey in the tech world began with low-level machine programming and circuit design.
Over the years, I transitioned into office automation and later ventured into full stack development, with a focus on backend systems.

I am not a Web Designer. I collaborate closely with designers and front-end engineers for the visual aspects of development processes.

My professional approach is structured: 
I first ensure functionality, then present it for client approval, and subsequently optimize and secure the solution. 
This method balances efficiency with future-proofing and security.

My goal is to develop systems that other developers can easily take over, providing a stable foundation for continued development. 
While my approach may not always be the most economical, I prioritize thoroughness in future-proofing and security.

Beyond programming, I enjoy researching technological innovations in engineering, broadening my expertise beyond software.
